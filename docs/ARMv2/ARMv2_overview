1. What was the elementary base of a computer/processor (relays,
vacuum tubes (aka thermoionic valves), transistors, magnetic cores,
integrated circuits (ICs) – were they hybrid, low scale integration,
Large Scale Integration (LSI), Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI),
modern microprocessors)? What where the physical characteristics of
the equipment (weight, size, power consumption)?

While we know that ARM architecture is widely used in majority of the phones these days, But it all started with ARMv2 . The result of the simulations on the ARM1 boards led to the late 1986 introduction of the ARM2 design running at 8 MHz, and the early 1987 speed-bumped version at 10 to 12 MHz. 

The elementary base of the ARMv2 architecture was Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI), specifically realized in the VL86C010 microprocessor. Designed by Acorn Computers and manufactured by VLSI Technology Inc., this 32-bit Reduced Instruction Set Computer (RISC) chip was fabricated using a 2.0 µm CMOS process. The processor contained 27,000 transistors and featured a die size of 34.13 mm² (5.842 mm × 5.842 mm). It was packaged in an 84-pin Plastic Leaded Chip Carrier (PLCC-84) measuring approximately 29.41 mm by 30.35 mm. While the chip was rated for clock frequencies of 10 MHz or 12 MHz, early implementations often utilized it at 8 MHz.

Regarding power consumption, the manufacturer’s datasheet specified a maximum power dissipation of 2 Watts. This figure represented the thermal limit of the package rather than typical usage. In practice, when operating within standard parameters, the chip was highly efficient, drawing approximately 0.1 Watts (100 mW). This low power draw allowed the processor to operate without a heatsink.

The equipment built around this processor, such as the Acorn Archimedes A300 series, typically followed a desktop form factor with separate peripherals. The main unit of the A310 measured 362mm in width, 406mm in depth, and 97mm in height, and it was powered by a 50-watt power supply unit. Later models like the Acorn Archimedes A3000 integrated the motherboard and keyboard into a single "all-in-one" chassis. This unit measured 470mm by 380mm and ran on an internal power supply rated at 22 Watts.

2.What type of architecture did both computers have? Were they
accumulator based, register based, stack based, memory-to-memory or
some other architectures?


The ARMv2 architecture, utilized in the VL86C010 processor, was a General Purpose Register (GPR) architecture, specifically classified as a Load/Store architecture. This design was different from accumulator-based architectures (such as the MOS 6502) or stack-based architectures. In the ARMv2 design, the processor could not perform arithmetic or logical operations directly on memory addresses. Instead, all processing happened within the internal register file. Data had to be explicitly loaded from memory into a register before it could be manipulated, and the results had to be stored back to memory using separate instructions.

This architecture relied on a bank of 27 physical 32-bit registers, but the programmer generally accessed a set of 16 logical registers (R0 through R15) in any given processor mode. This allowed the processor to save or keep variables locally available, this way it reduced the need to access slower main memory. A specific characteristic of the ARMv2 implementation was the usage of register R15. This register functioned as the Program Counter (PC) but also contained the Processor Status Register (PSR) flags in the upper bits. This dual usage of R15 restricted the addressable memory space to 26 bits or 64 MB.
